This project consists of my practice for latest features from Java version 8.
I have aimed for the following roadmap which consists of Java 8 to 21 features.

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Strengthen Java 8 (Foundation for Modern Java)
Most real-world projects still rely on Java 8 features, so master these first:
Lambdas & Functional Interfaces (Predicate, Consumer, Function)
Streams API (map, filter, reduce, collect, parallel streams)
Optional
Default & Static methods in Interfaces
Date & Time API (java.time)
ðŸ‘‰ Practice small problems: filtering lists, grouping data, date manipulations, etc.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Java 9â€“11 (Modules & Utility Updates)
Java 9 â†’ Modules (module-info.java), Stream.ofNullable(), takeWhile(), dropWhile(), Optional.ifPresentOrElse().
Java 10 â†’ var (local variable type inference).
Java 11 â†’ New String methods (isBlank, lines, repeat), Files.readString(), HttpClient API.
ðŸ‘‰ Practice by refactoring Java 8 code using var and new String/Stream APIs.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Java 12â€“14 (Preview Features Start)
Java 12 â†’ Switch Expressions (preview).
Java 13 â†’ Text Blocks (""" multiline strings """).
Java 14 â†’ Records (preview), Pattern Matching for instanceof.
ðŸ‘‰ Try rewriting switch cases with expressions, use text blocks for JSON/XML strings.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Java 15â€“17 (Stable Modern Java)
Java 15 â†’ Sealed Classes (preview).
Java 16 â†’ Records (stable), Pattern Matching (stable), Stream enhancements.
Java 17 (LTS) â†’ Sealed Classes (final), Pattern Matching refinements.
ðŸ‘‰ Use Records for DTOs in a sample project, experiment with sealed hierarchies.

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Java 18â€“21 (Latest & Future-Oriented)
Java 18 â†’ UTF-8 as default charset, simple web server for testing.
Java 19 â†’ Virtual Threads (preview, Project Loom).
Java 20 â†’ Scoped values, more Loom improvements.
Java 21 (LTS) â†’ Virtual Threads (final), Pattern Matching for switch (final), Record patterns, Sequenced Collections API.
ðŸ‘‰ Write a small multithreading demo with Virtual Threads and compare with normal threads.

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Practical Learning Approach
Learn Features Incrementally â†’ Donâ€™t jump to Java 21 directly. Move in order, but focus more on Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 (all LTS versions).
Hands-on Mini Projects â†’
Data filtering with Streams/Optionals.
REST client with Java 11 HttpClient.
DTOs with Records.
Concurrent task executor with Virtual Threads.
Resources:
Modern Java in Action (covers 8â€“11 well).
Java official release notes (very concise).
Practice on Exercism or LeetCode using new features.
